-	Use gofmt to format your code automatically. Don’t fight the formatter.
-	Write clear and concise package names. Use lowercase, single-word names without underscores -r mixed caps.
-	Follow Go naming conventions:
-	Use MixedCaps or mixedCaps for multiword names, not underscores
-	Capitalize exported names
-	Use short, descriptive names for variables and functions
-	Utilize Go’s built-in error handling. Return errors as values, not exceptions.
-	Take advantage of multiple return values, especially for error handling.
-	Use defer for cleanup operations like closing files or unlocking mutexes.
-	Prefer composition over inheritance. Use embedding to include functionality from other -ypes.
-	Make use of interfaces for abstraction. Define interfaces for the methods you need.
-	Utilize Go’s concurrency primitives:
-	Use goroutines for concurrent tasks
-	Use channels for communication between goroutines
-	Remember: “Don’t communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating”
-	Leverage the blank identifier (_) when you need to ignore return values.
-	Use type switches to handle multiple types in interfaces.
-	Write clear documentation comments for packages, functions, and types.
-	Avoid unnecessary else clauses. Handle errors early and return.
-	Use named return values when it improves clarity.
-	Make good use of the init() function for package initialization when needed.
-	Remember that semicolons are mostly implicit in Go. Don’t add them unnecessarily.
-	Use the built-in testing package for unit tests.
-	Utilize Go’s powerful slice and map types effectively.
-	Remember to check for nil before dereferencing pointers.
-	Use the context package for managing cancellations and deadlines across API boundaries.
-	Follow the principle of “Accept interfaces, return structs” in your API design.
-	Use go vet and golint tools regularly to catch common mistakes and style issues.
