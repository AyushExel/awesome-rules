# A collection of rules templates

A collection of community and official rules for AI coding assistants, designed to improve code quality, consistency, and development practices across different languages and frameworks.

## What are Rules?

Rules are configuration files that guide AI coding assistants in generating better code by establishing standards, conventions, and best practices. They help ensure consistent code style, proper testing approaches, security considerations, and framework-specific patterns.

For more detailed information about how rules work, see the [Continue documentation on rules](https://docs.continue.dev/customize/deep-dives/rules).

## Repository Structure

This repository is a centralized source for both community-driven and official rules for AI coding assistants. Our goal is to help developers, organizations, and open source communities define, share, and enforce best practices and guidelines for AI-powered coding tools.

## How to Use This Repository

- **Browse Rules:** Explore the `community/` folder for rules contributed by the community, and the `global/` folder for official rules recognized by the Continue team.
- **Adopt Rules:** Copy or reference rules in your own AI coding assistant workflows.
- **Contribute:** Share your own rules or help improve existing ones!

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone! Please follow these guidelines:

- **Community Rules:**  
  If you want to contribute a rule or guideline for general use, open a Pull Request (PR) adding your file(s) to the [`community/`](./community) folder.

- **Official/Global Rules:**  
  If you represent an open source community or organization and want your rules to appear as an official rule for Continue users, open a PR to the [`global/`](./global) folder. Please include a short description and any relevant links or documentation.

- **General Guidelines:**  
  - Use clear, concise language.
  - Include a brief description at the top of each rule file.
  - Where possible, provide examples or rationale.
  - Follow the existing folder and file naming conventions.
